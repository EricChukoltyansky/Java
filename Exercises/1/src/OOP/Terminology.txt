1. To create a new Object in the database, you need to create a new instance of the Object class and 
set the properties of the Object. For example, to create a new Object of the type "Person" with the 
name "John Doe", you would do the following:

Person person = new Person();

person.setName("John Doe");

2. The address of the object is assigned to a variable in the stack. The object is created in the heap.

3. If only a variable is created, the variable is assigned a null value. The object is not created.

4. If an object is created without assigning it to a variable, it is automatically destroyed
 by the garbage collector.
